"""Signal-disagreement damping experiment (Option B).

Hypothesis: when the model's prediction is supported by FEW of the underlying signals
(record, FIP, bullpen, wRC+, recent form), it's overconfident. Damp the probability
toward 50% based on how few signals agree.

Method:
  1. Re-run the production 5-feature model on every 2022-2025 finalized game (using
     season-aware data, no lookahead)
  2. For each game, compute the 5 signals and check which support the model's pick
  3. Slice by "signal count supporting pick" (0-5) and measure:
     - Predicted probability (mean, by pick tier)
     - Actual win rate
     - Calibration gap (predicted - actual)
  4. The slices with the biggest predicted-vs-actual gap tell us where damping helps
  5. Try several damping rules and report which performs best on a 2025 holdout

Limitations:
  - bullpen_era, wrc_plus are season-aggregates. For mid-season games (April-May),
    a 2025-05-18 pick would use full-season 2025 stats, which include games AFTER
    the pick was made. This is a mild lookahead bias for the signal-tag analysis
    only, not for the model itself. Helpers already have a season<=game_year filter
    via yesterday's fix, but they return the latest available value within that.
  - We only have 4 years of data. With 5 signals × probability tiers, slices get
    thin. We use a 2022-2024 fit / 2025 holdout split.

Usage:
    python -m model.signal_damping_experiment
